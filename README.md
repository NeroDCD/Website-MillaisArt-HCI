## Objective
- Choosing proper colors and animation.

## Description
Color adds dimension and realism to screen usability. It draws attention and, when used properly, can emphasize the logical organization of information, facilitate discrimination of screen components, accentuate differences among elements, and make displays more interesting. However, improper use of color can be distracting and visually fatiguing, impairing the system’s usability.

Animation is a dynamic visual form, evolving through movement over time. It is a popular element in various computing environments, especially on Web pages and in online advertisements. When used effectively, animation enhances the user experience.

## Student’s Task
Develop a UI for an artist who is a celebrity in some form of art (music, dance, painting, martial arts, etc., but not actors). The website will display their works and should reflect their character. Wix or WordPress can be used to create the website.
